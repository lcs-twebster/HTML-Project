    <article class= "content">
      <p>What is your gut? Some people call the gut "the body's second brain." This is because it regulates so many functions in your body. The term "the gut" refers to the entire digestive tract from the esophagus and down. (see figure 1) One of roles of the gut is to break down food into its nutrient components so that they may be absorbed into the blood through the intestinal wall. The breakdown occurs in the stomach with the help of acid, bile produced in the liver, and pancreatic enzymes. The pancreas also produces a hormone called insulin which manages blood sugar levels. The absorbtion of nutrients takes place in the small intestine. The gut has many other functions and roles in your body, and this is mainly due to a diverse colony of bacteria which populate the large intestine.</p>
