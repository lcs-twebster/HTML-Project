    <article class= "content">
      <p>What is your gut? Some people call the gut "the body's second brain." This is because it regulates so many functions in your body. The term "the gut" refers to the entire digestive tract from the esophagus and down. (see Figure 1) One of roles of the gut is to break down food into its nutrient components so that they may be absorbed into the blood through the intestinal wall. The breakdown occurs in the stomach with the help of acid, bile produced in the liver, and pancreatic enzymes. The pancreas also produces a hormone called insulin which manages blood sugar levels. The absorbtion of nutrients takes place in the small intestine. The gut has many other functions and roles in your body, and this is mainly due to a diverse colony of bacteria which populate the large intestine.</p>

    <h2 id= "microbiomeInfo">The Gut Microbiome</h2>

    <article class= "content">
      <p>The majority of one's microbiota live in the large intestine. This diverse collection of bacteria coexist while feeding on dietary fiber. This fiber is found in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains. It is a type of fiber that cannot be broken down by the body and absorbed in the small intestine. However, humans have evolved to have their bodies be home to bacteria which feed on this undigestable fiber. There are dozens of types of microbes in the microbiome. (see figures 2-4 for examples.) Each has a unique diet and prefers fiber from different foods. For example, one species may feed on fiber from bananas and apples, while another feeds on fiber from chia and flax seeds. After a microbe digests fiber, it produces a substance such as a neurotransmitter or metabolite. Neurotransmitters produced by the microbiota such as seratonin, dopamine, and GABA signal the brain to reduce feelings of fear and anxiety. Metabolites such as amino acids help regulate the body's metabolic function. These substances are crucial to keep our bodies functioning. Since each microbe produces a different substance based on its diet, it is of utmost importance to nurture a healthy, diverse microbiome so that one can feel their best.  </p>

    <h2 id= "gutBrain">The Gut-Brain Axis</h2>

    <article class= "content">
      <p>The gut and the brain are closely intertwined. They share a two-way connection through a part of the nervous system called the enteric nervous system. The enteric nervous system is comprised of neural circuits. It's job is to regualte bloodflow and the secretion of mucus, as well as regulate certain of the immune and endochrine systems. Because of this connection, what affects the brain affects the gut, and visa versa. For example, if one is stressed then it is common to have constipation or diarrhea. When one is nervous it is common to have the "butterfly" sensation in the stomach. The gut also affects the brain. FOr example, when one eats a poor diet and does not feed their microbiota, the microbiota will be producing fewer neurotransmitters such as dopamine and seratonin. This will lead to unseady and poor mood. Make sure to maintain a healthy gut and limit stress to prevent the gut-brain axis from creating negative effects on the body.</p>

    <h2 id= "lifestyle">Promoting Gut Health</h2>

    <article class= "content">
      <p>One of the easiest things one can do to live a gut-healthy lifestyle is to eat plenty of fruits, veggies, and whole grains. Eating a diet based on these foods will provied plenty of dietary fiber for the microbiota to feed on. In turn, the microbiome will grow and flourish, providing the body with plenty of the metabolites produced by the microbes. Try to structure meals around plant-based content and swap simple carbs like white bread and pasta for whole grain options. Another easy food choice is to add fermented foods to your diet such as plain yogurt, sourcrout, kombucha, miso, sourdough bread, and kimchi. There are many more options as well. Fermented foods are made using gut-beneficial bacteria. While food-ingested microbes only stay in the body temporarily, consuming them still provides benefits for the duration of their stay. Be sure to avoid foods with added sugars, low fiber, and that are highly proscessed as they are harmful to the microbiome and inflammatory for the body. Another way to nurture gut healt is with gentle exercise such as yoga. The bending and twisting motions of the poses improve digestion by helping food move through the digestive tract. Also, drinking plenty of water also makes for a smooth digestive process. In short, a plant-based diet low in processed foods nurture the microbiome, and water and exercize help improve digestion.
