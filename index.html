    <article class= "content">
      <p>What is your gut? Some people call the gut "the body's second brain." This is because it regulates so many functions in your body. The term "the gut" refers to the entire digestive tract from the esophagus and down. (see Figure 1) One of roles of the gut is to break down food into its nutrient components so that they may be absorbed into the blood through the intestinal wall. The breakdown occurs in the stomach with the help of acid, bile produced in the liver, and pancreatic enzymes. The pancreas also produces a hormone called insulin which manages blood sugar levels. The absorbtion of nutrients takes place in the small intestine. The gut has many other functions and roles in your body, and this is mainly due to a diverse colony of bacteria which populate the large intestine.</p>

    <article class= "content">
      <p>The majority of one's microbiota live in the large intestine. This diverse collection of bacteria coexist while feeding on dietary fiber. This fiber is found in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains. It is a type of fiber that cannot be broken down by the body and absorbed in the small intestine. However, humans have evolved to have their bodies be home to bacteria which feed on this undigestable fiber. There are dozens of types of microbes in the microbiome. (see figures 2-4 for examples.) Each has a unique diet and prefers fiber from different foods. For example, one species may feed on fiber from bananas and apples, while another feeds on fiber from chia and flax seeds. After a microbe digests fiber, it produces a substance such as a neurotransmitter or metabolite. Neurotransmitters produced by the microbiota such as seratonin, dopamine, and GABA signal the brain to reduce feelings of fear and anxiety. Metabolites such as amino acids help regulate the body's metabolic function. These substances are crucial to keep our bodies functioning. Since each microbe produces a different substance based on its diet, it is of utmost importance to nurture a healthy, diverse microbiome so that one can feel their best.  </p>
