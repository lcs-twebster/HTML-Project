        <h1>Bacteria in the Microbiome</h1>
      </header>
      <p>The gut microbiome of the average human contains trillions of microbes. Scientists estimate that about 99% of those microbes come from 30-40 species. The most common species in adults is Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Studies have shown the this species prefers to feed on the fibers from chicory roots, wheat, onion, banana, garlic, and leek. Another common type of bacteria is Streptococcus thermophilus. These beneficial microbes are typically found in yogurt or other fermented dairy products. Lactobactillus is a common species with many subspecies. They can be found in a wide variety of fermented foods as well as in probiotic supplements. Each person's has a unique microbiome, like a fingerprint. No two people have all the same types and amounts of microbes in their gut. Because of this, it is difficult to create a specific diet of what one should eat or supplements one shoud take to support their microbiota. However, it is certain that they feed on plant fibers, so be sure to eat a wide variety of plant foods. Research is currently being conducted through blood tests and stool samples from subjects to learn more about how to personalize a diet based on one's microbial makeup, and it is showing promising results. With further research scientists will understand much more about the microbes in the human body and how we can use them to our greatest advantage.<br><br> Below is a detailed video about the bacterial make up of the human body. <br></p>
