      <h2 id= "functions">Specific Functions</h2>
      <p>The main functions of the digestive system are to ingest and digest food, absorb nutrients, and eliminate waste. The purpose of digestion is to break down food into nutrients that can be transported in the bloodstream to fuel the cells of the body. It takes about 3-6 hours for food to pass through the stomach, and about 36 to complete the entire digestive process. Be sure to eat nothing at least 2 hours before sleeping to allow your digestive system time to rest and repair instead of digesting through the night. To optimize digestion eat plenty of fiber and drink lots of water. Gentle exercise also helps with the digestion process. Overall, the job of the digestive system is to extract nutrients from food to feed the cells of the body, and eliminate the remaining waste products.</p>

      <h2 id= "mouth">The Mouth</h2>
      <p>The mouth, also known as the oral cavity is made up of connective tissue and mucous membranes. It is lined with connective tissue and covered by a mucous membrane that keeps it moist. Inside the mouth is the tongue, which is made of smooth muscle tissue and covered with taste buds that connect to nerves that send signals to the brain. The tongue pushes food towards the pharynx for swallowing. Teeth in the mouth are made of dentin and covered with a hard layer of enamel. They chop and grind up food. Salivary glands in the mouth are made of epithelial tissue, fat, and mucous. There are three sets of salivary glands in the mouth. They’re the first step in breaking down carbohydrates, and also mix with the food when chewed to moisten it and help create a small ball called the bolus, which is food when ready to be swallowed.</p>

      <h2 id= "pharynx-esophagus">The Pharynx & Esophagus</h2>
      <p>The pharynx is the back of the throat, and is made of connective and epithelial tissue. It connects the mouth to the esophagus, and the tongue pushes the bolus into it so that it can be swallowed into the esophagus. The pharynx also contains a small, thin structure called the epiglottis that covers the trachea when food or liquids are being swallowed to prevent choking.<br>The esophagus is a tube in the neck runs from the pharynx to the stomach. It is made of smooth muscle tissue, and is stretchy to allow for food to pass down it. It moves food down it through muscle contractions called peristalsis, which are like little waves moving along the muscle. There is a ring of smooth muscle at the bottom of the esophagus called the esophageal sphincter. It keeps the esophagus closed so that food in the stomach can’t come back into it.</p>

      <h2 id= "stomach">The Stomach</h2>
      <p>The stomach is a sac made of smooth muscle tissue. The tissue has ridges called rugae which contract to churn the food and help with break down. The stomach breaks down food using hydrochloric acid (HCL). The cells in the lining of the stomach release hormones that trigger the stomach to release other digestive juices which also break down food. There is a sphincter at the inferior end of the stomach called the pyloric sphincter which opens to let the food pass into the small intestine. Once the stomach finishes break down, the food has become a liquid called chyme.</p>

      <h2 id= "liver-gallbladder">The Liver & Gallbladder</h2>
      <p>The liver is the largest organ in the digestive system. It is around three pounds and made of smooth muscle and connective tissues. The liver produces bile; a liquid that breaks down fats into fatty acids. Bile is transported from the liver to the duodenum through bile ducts. The gallbladder is a pear shaped organ made of smooth muscle tissue. It stores extra bile, and also prepares bile from the small intestine for reuse.</p>

      <h2 id= "small-intestine">The Small Intestine</h2>
      <p>The small intestine is a long (about 10 feet) tube made of smooth muscle tissue connecting to the stomach. It is divided into three parts: the first is the duodenum, second is the jejunum, and third is the ileum. The duodenum mixes chyme with bile to break down fats. Before it reaches the jejunum, the duodenum mixes any stomach acids with bicarbonate to neutralize it. The jejunum mixes chyme with pancreatic juices to break down sugars and carbohydrates into glucose, and protein into amino acids. It then absorbs them and the fatty acids into the bloodstream. The ileum absorbs leftover nutrients, which is typically vitamin B12, and also sends any leftover bile back to the gallbladder. The small intestines are lined with small fingerlike projections called villi that provide a greater surface area for absorption.</p>

      <h2 id= "large-intestine">The Large Intestine</h2>
      <p>The large intestine is a tube around five feet long and is made of smooth muscle tissue. It connects to the small intestine and then the rectum. It absorbs water and vitamin K. It also contains bacteria which break down waste, creating feces. This then moves into the rectum. </p>

      <h2 id= "pancreas">The Pancreas</h2>
      <p>The pancreas is a gland that is also part of the endocrine system. It is made of ducts, epithelial tissue, connective tissue, and exocrine tissue. It secretes pancreatic juices made of multiple enzymes into the duodenum and jejunum that break down fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. It also secretes hormones called insulin and glucagon that manage blood sugar levels.</p>

      <h2 id= "rectum">The Rectum</h2>
      <p>The rectum is the last section of the large intestine. It is made of smooth muscle tissue and it’s walls contain stretch receptors. It stores feces and the stretch receptors connect to nerves that signal the brain when it’s time for a bowel movement. Feces exits the body through the anus, which has an opening controlled by an external sphincter muscle.</p>
